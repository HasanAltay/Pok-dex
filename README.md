## About Pokédex API

Welcome to my portfolio website, featuring information and characters from the popular Pokémon franchise. This website was built using the Pokédex API, a web-based service that allows users to access and retrieve information about the various Pokémon characters.

The Pokédex API provides access to a wealth of information about all of your favorite Pokémon characters, including their names, abilities, moves, and statistics. With this API, I was able to create a website that showcases my skills as a developer, while also providing a fun and interactive experience for visitors.

The website features different sections for you to discover all features, including a detailed information on each Pokémon, a search function and a comparison feature to compare multiple Pokémon at once.

Please note that this website is intended solely for demonstration purposes. Pokémon is a protected trademark of Nintendo and the use of the term "Pokémon" and associated content in connection with the Pokedex API is for informational purposes only and is not intended for the promotion of products or services.

## Using the Pokédex API

The Pokédex API is a RESTful API that returns data in JSON format. It can be used to create a wide range of applications and services such as video games, mobile apps, and websites. It can also be used by researchers and data analysts to gather and analyze information about the Pokémon franchise.
