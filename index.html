                    <h2>About Pokédex API</h2>
                    <span>
                        Welcome to my portfolio website, featuring Pokémon characters 
                        and information from the popular Pokémon franchise. 
                        This website was built using the Pokédex API, which provides 
                        access to a wealth of information about all of your favorite 
                        Pokémon characters, including their names, abilities, moves, 
                        and statistics. With this API, I was able to create a website 
                        that showcases my skills as a developer, while also providing 
                        a fun and interactive experience for visitors.
                        Don't hesitate to check out the different sections of the website 
                        to discover all features. Feel free to contact me if you have 
                        any questions or feedback.
                        A Pokédex API, also known as a Pokémon API, is a type 
                        of web-based service that allows users to access and retrieve 
                        information about the various Pokémon characters from the popular 
                        Pokémon franchise. This information can include things like 
                        Pokémon names, abilities, moves, and statistics. 
                        These APIs can be used by developers to create a wide 
                        range of applications and services, such as video games, 
                        mobile apps, and websites. They can also be used by researchers 
                        and data analysts to gather and analyze information about the 
                        Pokémon franchise. The Pokédex API typically uses RESTful principles 
                        and returns data in JSON format.
